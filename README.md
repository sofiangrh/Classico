# Description:
What if you could bring back the classic MacOS style with a dash of NeXT for good measure? 
Well, you'd get Classico, a re-imagining of the classic MacOS theme "Platinum" for the modern GNOME desktop. 

The "Office" Metacity theme by lokheed is included in the package as well as the panel background. In order to get MacOS style menubars, you will need the Gnome Global Menu, available at: code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu.

This theme requires the latest Murrine.
